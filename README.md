## About the project

This project was built doing [this course](https://learn.handlebarlabs.com/p/react-native-basics-build-a-currency-converter) **(It's free!)**

I forgot to create a new repository for it, so all the steps I followed are in my main [study repository](https://github.com/arthurdenner/learning/) :facepalm:

This repository is different from what you might see in the course because instead of using [`redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [`redux-saga`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) (that I know pretty much), I decided to try and use [`redux-zero`](https://github.com/concretesolutions/redux-zero/) (and it's really good!).

The initial commit was when I published the app in Expo. [(see here)](https://expo.io/@arthurdenner/currency-converter)

## What's next then?

Well, since I've finished the course, I'm going to continue my study refactoring the app to use other packages that I'm interested about and adding some features.

#### Next steps

* [x] Use [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) - never used and it seems fantastic
* [ ] Persist user's theme choice - that's essencial
* [ ] Create the option to add more colors
